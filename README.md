# App Description

TMG Disease Predictor is an android application that predicts the type of disease
based on the selected plant category. Based on the disease type, we get the name of
the disease, the causative agent, scientific name and the recommended ways for
treatment. The symptoms provided as output help us to make sure that the disease
predicted is truthy or not. The application even tells us whether the leaf is healthy
or not.
